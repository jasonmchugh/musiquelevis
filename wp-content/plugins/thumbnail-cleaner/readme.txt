Cleans up your WordPress installation by removing and regenerating thumbnails.

== Description ==
**Thumbnails Cleaner** helps you keep your WordPress installation tidy by removing and regenerating thumbnails.

You can control all functions through the plugins’ main page found under “Tools”. You can:

* **Analyze** your uploads directory, giving you an overview how many original files and thumbnails there are.
* **Clean thumbnails** which means deleting them while keeping the original files.
* **Restore thumbnails** to start out with a clean uploads directory. This function requires the plugin [Regenerate Thumbnails](https://wordpress.org/plugins/regenerate-thumbnails/).
* **Create backups** of your uploads directory to keep your files safe in the unlikely event that there is a problem.
* **Restore backups** in case you have lost a file that was not supposed to be deleted.

**Please see the [official website](https://www.koljanolte.com/wordpress/plugins/thumbnail-cleaner/documentation/) for a full
